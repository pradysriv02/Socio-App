# Project Name: MERN Social Media App with Real-time Chatting

## Description:
This repository contains a full-stack social media application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and real-time chatting functionality implemented using Socket.IO. The app allows users to register, create profiles, post updates, like and comment on posts, and engage in real-time chat conversations with other users.

## Features:

1. User Authentication:
   - User registration and login functionality using email and password authentication.
   - Password hashing and salting for secure storage.
   - User session management and authentication middleware for protected routes.

2. User Profiles:
   - User profiles with customizable information such as profile picture, bio, and social media links.
   - Ability to update and view user profiles.

3. Post Creation and Interaction:
   - Create, edit, and delete posts with rich text formatting options.
   - Like and comment on posts.
   - View posts from other users in a news feed format.

4. Real-time Chatting:
   - Real-time chat functionality using Socket.IO.
   - Users can create private chat rooms and engage in one-on-one or group conversations.
   - Chat notifications and unread message indicators.

5. Deployment:
   - Configuration files for deploying the application on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
   - Instructions for setting up the database and environment variables.
